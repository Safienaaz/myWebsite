  <h1> The Cell Membrane </h1>
  
  <p>
    The Cell Membrane (aka the plasma membrane or the cell surface membrane) is a thin layer surrounding the cell which controls what goes in and out of the cell.
    This keeps the toxic and unwanted substances that can harm out. It is a gate for the nutrients to enter and the unwanted waste to go out. 
    It also controls the passage of ions and molecules in or out of the cell. Ions are charged atoms where the number of protons is different to the number of electrons
 Protons keep the nucleus together. The protons attract the electrons and keeping the orbit of the two continuous. The protons attract electrons as protons are 
    positively charged and electrons are negatively charged and opposite charges always attract each other.
